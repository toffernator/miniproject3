# miniproject3

We have tested the program using:
- Ubuntu running `docker-compose` version 1.27.4
- MacOS running `docker compose` version 2.0.0-rc.3

Ensure that docker compose is up to date, then run the program using:
- `make start-system` if you are on windows/macOS
- `make start-system-linux` if you are on linux

Then you can in another process execute `make start-client` to connect a client to the auction system.
